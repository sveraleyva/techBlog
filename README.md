## Description

This is a CMS-style blog site that operates similarly to a Wordpress site. Developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. It uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Experience

This assignment was a gigantic challenge. I think I have over 20 commits, because once I fixed something something else broke. However, I do feel a lot more confident about routes/models now, so all of my headaches were worth it.

## Credit

I used a lot of the code we worked on during class that's stored on Folder 14. We also worked on this during office hours. I used this tutorial to get Tailwind to work with Handlebars: https://dev.to/jumbo02/how-to-use-tailwind-css-in-an-expressjs-app-2c7c. I used flowbite for a lot of the formatting (https://flowbite.com/docs/components/card/). I also refered to this stack overflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34252817/handlebarsjs-check-if-a-string-is-equal-to-a-value. I didn't end up using the code, but it was helpful in figuring out how to make it so that only logged-in users were able to comment/edit/delete posts.
